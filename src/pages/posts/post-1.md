# My first post in the blog

Publish in: 2025-03-04

!Welcome to my _new_blog about the learning process in Astro, here I'll learn my learning process with everybody as I'm building my own website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro installation process**: I've created a new Astro project and configured my github repository.
2. **Page creation**: Then I learned how to create pages by creating new `.astro` files y putting them insde the `/src` folder.
3. **Posts creation**: This is my first Post! Now I have `astro` pages and `markdown` posts!

## Next steps

I'll finish the Astro tutorial, hten i"ll keep adding more pages to my website.
